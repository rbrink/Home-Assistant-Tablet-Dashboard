## Home Assistant Tablet Dashboard

As a lot of people are struggling to get a nice (atleast what I see as nice) dashboard. I created this repository to share what I currently use. I've shared the full lovelace code and pictures to show as example. If you have any troubles using this code, please create an issue and I will assist you.
